Hearts and Minds is a cooperative Military Simulation (MilSim) mission that aims to recreate a post war environment based on an insurgency gameplay.
CSAT forces retreated from Altis and NATO deployed units and vehicles to help the local population.
A new formed group, known as "Oplitas", is against the NATO intervention and is ready to fight.

### The mission has a lot of features:

- **Dedicated server support only**
- Dynamic battlefield
- Rearm system
- Repair wreck system
- Logistic system
- Interaction system
- Realistic IED/Suicide/Drone bomber system
- Civilian interaction/fleeing
- Reputation system
- Deep ACE3 support
- More than 197 enemies and 21 civilians factions available
- More than 14 side mission
- Dynamic caching system
- Full saving Database
- Easy map change
- Extend battlefield to sea
- Custom gameplay
- Headless support
- Something I forgot for sure


You main task is to defeat the "Oplitas" group and restore peace and order in Altis.
The militia has an unknown number of hideouts in the island that need to be destroyed.
They have also ammo caches in various locations, destroy them to weaken its power.

Bad actions cause bad effects.
Infact there's a reputation system: helping the local population, fighting the "Oplitas", disarming IED will rise your reputation; killing civilians, mutilate alive/dead civilian, firing near civilians for no reason, damaging/destroying buildings, losing vehicles, respawns will decrease your reputation.
At the beginning you have a very low reputation level, so civilians won't help you revealing important information about Oplitas, they will likely lie instead.
