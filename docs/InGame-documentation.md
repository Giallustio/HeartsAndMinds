### Respawn:
 When a vehicle is destroyed it will not respawn in base, you need to tow or lift it back to base and repair it near the logistic point (Interact with the red box). Helicopter wrecks can only be lifted. The Chinook is the only exception, it will respawn after 30 seconds.
### Rearm:
You can also rearm them by spawning the corresponding caliber at logistic point (Interact with the red box, select the vehicle type and caliber). Carry the ammo created and interact with the vehicle to rearm. This only works if rearming is setting on entire magazine or amount based on caliber (not for entire vehicle setting).


## Side Mission

A side mission can be requested by the officer with his self interaction menu.
If you don't want to complete a task, you can always abort it with the self interaction menu.

	Move it where you want to deploy a new FOB and interact with it to set it up. Keep in mind that you can not deploy a FOB close to the main base (2.500m) and the terrain needs to be flat.
	- Dismantle:
	You can dismantle a FOB by interacting with the flag on the HQ roof.

- Rallypoint:
	You can also use the Zeus rallypoint backpack available in Arsenal. Those have a limited number of respawn.


## Sling loading
=BTC= Lift will not replace the A3 sling loading, you can use both.
Lifting an object is pretty simple. Get in a chopper as pilot, hover above the object and interact with the chopper to deploy ropes.
When you are in the right position a new scroll wheel action will appear ('HOOK'). If you want you can open the HUD to facilitate the operation.
To release an object open you self interaction menu and select 'CUT ROPES'.

- Use ACE 3 Cargo system.

### Towing system:
To tow a vehicle interact with it and select the option 'HOOK'.After that place the tow vehicle in front of it and select 'TOW' in the interaction menu.
If the two vehicles are too far away or the vehicle can't tow that load (Car can't tow truck or tank), the option will be disabled.
To unhook interact with one of the two vehicles and select the option 'UNHOOK'.

### Place option:
With this option you can move heavy objects to build small outpost or base.
When you select the option an hint will show all the keys required to move the object.


## Hideout
The hideouts are a place where the Oplitas organize their movements.
They send reinforcements from here and can attack the closest city.
If you notice a lot of activity in an area, probably there is an hideout closeby.
If you want to defeat the Oplitas, you need to destroy all their hideouts.
To destroy an hideout just place a satchel near the ammo box, it's close to the flag and blow it off!


## IED
Any object could be an IED, approach it carefully (DO NOT rotate while you are walking: prefer walk, stop, rotate, walk again etc). Turn On your mine detector (VMH3 or VMMH3) and search for a charge in a circle of 2 meter around.
If you are an engineer and have a defusal kit, you can disarm it.
You can also blow them off with high caliber and explosive satchels.


## Intel
Intel can be retrieved in the following:
- Searching dead bodies
- Interrogate prisoner
- Talking to civilians

Keep in mind that only the interpreter can talk to civilians and they can lie if your reputation level is low.
When you find an intel from a dead body or interrogate a prisoner, a marker will appear in the map. Remember, prisoner have a random number of intel more or less interesting.

There are two types of intel:
- Red question mark and pictures under diary log map menu: ammo cache intel
- Red exclamation mark: hideout intel

When you destroy an hideout or an ammo cache, all the markers related to it will be deleted.


## Reputation
Reputation can be ask to civilian. Bad actions cause bad effects.

Helping the local population, fighting the Oplitas, disarming IED will rise your reputation; killing civilians, mutilate alive/dead civilian, firing near civilians for no reason, damaging/destroying buildings, losing vehicles, respawns will decrease your repution. At the beginning you have a very low reputation level, so civilians won't help you revealing important information about Oplitas, they will likely lie instead.

Aborting a side mission does not affect reputation.


## Civil Orders
Any player can give orders to civilians. To do this, just open your self interaction menu and select 'ORDERS' or use one of the shortcuts. Shortcuts can changed under 'configure >> controls>> configure addons >> Hearts and Minds: Mission (drop down menu)'. Your options are:
- STOP
- GET DOWN
- GO AWAY

If you want to give an order to just one unit, interact with it (object interaction).

You can also drop leaflets to ask all civilians in a circle of 200m to evacuate to a religious building (if not available a safe area) with a AR-2 drone.

## Traffic
Civilians are travelling by vehicle across cities. If your reputation is higher than normal, you can ask for a lift to a location chosen on the map. If you bump into a Oplitas patrol, don't worry, the civilian driver will do their best to hide you in the car.


## Gear
You can choose your gear at the red box inside the base. Located at the spawn point.


## Interaction
Use ACE 3 interactions system.
