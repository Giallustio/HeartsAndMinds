# Tips :
- Some map does not provide enough city. You can add new cities by using `btc_custom_loc` in [/define_mod.sqf#L1](https://github.com/Vdauphin/HeartsAndMinds/blob/master/%3DBTC%3Dco%4030_Hearts_and_Minds.Altis/define_mod.sqf#L1) like it has been talk [here](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/165948-mp-btc-hearts-and-minds/?page=39&tab=comments#comment-3280136).
- For small map, you should tweak the safezone for hideout spawn ([/core/def/mission.sqf#L159](https://github.com/Vdauphin/HeartsAndMinds/blob/master/%3DBTC%3Dco%4030_Hearts_and_Minds.Altis/core/def/mission.sqf#L159)).
- [Some map](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/165948-mp-btc-hearts-and-minds/?page=52&tab=comments#comment-3348268) use only NameCity for the type of locations but H&M hideouts system looks for "NameLocal", "Hill", "NameVillage", "Airport". You should add in the array the "NameCity" [here](https://github.com/Vdauphin/HeartsAndMinds/blob/master/%3DBTC%3Dco%4030_Hearts_and_Minds.Altis/core/fnc/hideout/create.sqf#L49).
