@Giallustio implemented it by two way, the simpler, for me, is explain here:
- in arma editor: create your base where you want.
- in arma editor: create a marker next to your base name for exemple : YOUR_MARKER_AREA
- open with your text editor file [core/fnc/city/init.sqf L64-L67](https://github.com/Vdauphin/HeartsAndMinds/blob/master/%3DBTC%3Dco%4030_Hearts_and_Minds.Altis/core/fnc/city/init.sqf#L64-L67) , uncomment (remove `/*` and `*/` command):

>     /*
>     //if you want a safe area
>     if (_position distance getMarkerPos "YOUR_MARKER_AREA" < 500) exitWith {};
>     */

Note : you can tweak radius of desactivation by changing `500` meters by more or less. Make sure your marker radius is large enough to reach out and overlap the epicenter of the town you want to black out.
